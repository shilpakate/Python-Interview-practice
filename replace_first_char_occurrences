# 11.	 Write a Python program to get a string from a given string where all occurrences of its first char have been changed to '$', except the first char itself.
  Sample String : 'restart'
   Expected Result : 'resta$t'


def replace_first_char_occurrences(input_string):
    if len(input_string) <= 1:
        return input_string  # Return the string as is if it's empty or has only one character

    first_char = input_string[0]
    modified_string = first_char  # Initialize the modified string with the first character

    for char in input_string[1:]:
        if char == first_char:
            modified_string += '$'  # Replace occurrences of the first character with '$'
        else:
            modified_string += char  # Keep other characters unchanged

    return modified_string

# Example usage:
sample_string = 'restart'
result = replace_first_char_occurrences(sample_string)
print("Expected Result:", result)
